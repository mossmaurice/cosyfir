Cosyfir shall help you watering your plants.

The node software runs on an STM32 ARM Cortex microcontroller. The server software runs on UNIX-based systems like Debian. The following picture depicts an example setup:

    ./node/* (Not part of cosyfir)  ./server/*

This readme describes both the server (e.g. Raspberry Pi) and the sensor node software in the following sections.

## Server

The cosyfird application is a daemon, which receives messages from sensor nodes via TTN server and displays the last
message.

### Required hard- and software

* Computer running UNIX-like OS e.g. Raspberry Pi with Raspbian

Install the following software packages e.g. for Debian do:

    sudo apt install libncurses6 libmosquittopp1 libssl1.1 libyaml-cpp0.6 gcc cmake libjsoncpp1 libb64-0d

C++17 compiler is required. GCC 8.3.0 is recommended.

## Sensor node

This section describes the sensor node software which communicates based on [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) and [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/).

### Required hard- and software

* [LSN50 v1.2](http://www.dragino.com/products/lora-lorawan-end-node/item/128-lsn50.html) from Dragino (I bought it [here](https://www.exp-tech.de/plattformen/internet-of-things-iot/8377/dragino-lsn50-868-12-waterproof-long-range-wireless-lora-sensor-node))
  * STM32L072CZT6
  * Semtech SX1276
  * Battery
  * IP66 case
* DS18B20 temperature sensor
* FTDI UART cable
* UNIX machine
  * [stm32flash](https://sourceforge.net/p/stm32flash/wiki/Home/) version  >=0.5

Install the following packages:

    sudo apt install stm32flash arm-none-eabi-gcc

## Build and setup

Before building the binaries, let's register our cosyfir application on the TTN website.

### Setup cosyfird and cosyfir-node with TTN

The following is a YAML configuration file template for cosyfird:

```yaml
MqttConfig:
    HostAddress: region.thethings.network
    Port: 8883
    ClientId: application-id
    Password: secret
```

TTN uses port `8883` with SSL and the host address `region.thethings.network` where `region` can be e.g. `eu`.

First of all, create a client identifier on the TTN site by clicking "Add application" on your personal
[network console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/). The application access key can be found at the bottom after
you have created an application. It acts as the password for the MQTT connection.

Here's an overview of the LoRa terminology:

| LoRa              | Explanation                           | From where?                          | Where to?       |
| ------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|:---------------:|
| DevEUI            | 64-bit end-device identifier (unique) | On device box ("Register device")    | TTN console     |
| AppEUI or JoinEUI | 64-bit application identifier         | Issued by TTN ("Add application")    | Commissioning.h |
| AppKey            | Data encryption key (TTN <-> server)  | Generated by TTN ("Add application") | Commissioning.h |
| DevAddr           | 32-bit address (non-unique)           | Assigned when node joins TTN         | -               |

The activation method will always be over-the-air-activation (OTAA).

Fill the defines into `node/Commissioning.h-template` as described in the table. Then do:

    mv node/Commissioning.h-template node/Commissioning.h

### Start the build

Run the build script in root to build both server and node binary.

    ./build_all.sh

Available parameters to the script are:

* `clean`: Perform a clean build

### How to flash the sensor node

Flashing LSN50 can be done with a simple FTDI UART cable using the ISP boot mode.

Connect the UART as described below:

    GND (black):  JP4 Pin11 GND
    TXD (orange): JP3 Pin9 PA3 (USART1)
    RXD (yellow): JP3 Pin10 PA2 (USART1)

Find out where your USB serial device is mounted:

    journalctl -k -n 100

Set the switch from flash mode to ISP mode and then do:

    sudo stm32flash -w node/build/cosyfir-node /dev/ttyUSBx

## Get cosyfir running

Check your local [TTN coverage](https://ttnmapper.org/) and make sure a gateway is nearby. Start `./cosyfird` and
power on the LSN50. After a few moments you should see messages arrive. In debug mode, messages are sent every minute.
In release mode every hour.

Example message payload in hex:

    | CA | FE | F0 | 0D | BE | EF |
      ^
      Battery level
                ^
                Temperature
                          ^
                          Soil water tension

## Development

For development the following packages might be necessary:

    sudo apt install clang-format libmosquittopp-dev libssl-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libjsoncpp-dev libb64-dev libncurses-dev

### Debugging with STM32

Get an ST-LINK V2 debugger and install these packages:

    sudo apt install stmlink-tools

Three applications are available after installation:

* **st-flash**, for flashing binaries
* **st-info**, get infos about the microcontroller
* **st-utils**, attach GDB to the microcontroller

## Todo

* Add CMake flag for support of different nodes (e.g. sensor or actor)
  * Split main.c into common and specific part (sensor or actor)
